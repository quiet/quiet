{"name":"Quiet","tagline":"Encode data into 44.1kHz","body":"Quiet\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis library uses liquid SDR to encode and decode data through 44.1kHz. This makes it suitable for sending data across a 3.5mm headphone jack from one device to another. It can also be built using emscripten to generate a .js file which can do transmission and reception from the browser.\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----------\r\nBuilding this project on a modern computer is somewhat tricky as libfec does not know about 64-bit architectures. I have a customized version which can handle this case which should be coming soon.\r\n\r\nOnce the dependencies are installed, `cd` to this project's dir and run `cmake .` and `make`.\r\n\r\nJavascript\r\n-----------\r\nGenerating the emscripten build requires that all dependencies be built with emscripten (e.g. `emconfigure ./configure; emmake make; make install`) for each dependency. After the emscripten-compiled dependencies are installed, run this project's `./build_js`.\r\n\r\nAlternately, you may use the precompiled `web/encode.js` provided by this project. Be sure to include the third party license information in `web/LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.txt`.\r\n\r\nProfiles\r\n-----------\r\nThe encoding and decoding process are controlled by the profiles in `web/profiles.json`. Each profile contains a complete set of parameters such as modem type and error correction. This project uses libjansson to read the profiles and then select one based on a given profile name.\r\n\r\nUltrasonic\r\n-----------\r\nThe `highfreq` profile encodes data into a very low bitrate, but the audio content falls entirely between 18.5kHz and 19.5kHz, which should pass through audio equipment relatively well while being inaudible to the average person. This is a good option for sending data through a channel where you would prefer not to disrupt or notify human listeners.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n-----------\r\n* [Liquid DSP](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp)\r\n* [libfec](http://www.ka9q.net/code/fec/)\r\n* [Jansson](https://github.com/akheron/jansson)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
